        <h3>Coding</h3>
        <p>Pretty much all I have time for. It's taken over my life but in a good way. I'm learning a lot and I'm enjoying the challenge.</p>

        <h3>Yard Work</h3>
        <p>I actually love yard work, it's cathartic It's also a good way to get some exercise and just get outside for a bit. I rarely let anyone else do it, I like that it's MY labor out there!</p>

        <p>Not really a hobby but I enjoy it! After coding and keeping up my house, there's really not much else I can do! Plus I'm less annoying when I sleep.</p>

        <h3>Chiefs</h3>
        <p>I bleed for these guys. I scream, I curse, I pull my hair out. I love everything about this team, and I did NOT just start liking them since they became good. I love them just as much when they're winning the same as when they're losing. I yell myself horse at the games and if I can't make it, I shout at the TV. I always tell people, "dont' watch the games with me...you will hate every minute of it"</p>

        <h3>Patrick Mahomes</h3>
        <p>And of course, the big guy...the MVP...the man with the plan. I can't saye enough about this guy. I bought his jersey waaaaay before he was the best QB in the NFL. Trust me, I like him more than most of my family. He is the boss, and a good guy to go with it.</p>
